# The Green Avengers

Our webiste is hosted at - [The Green Avengers](https://thegreenavengers.herokuapp.com/)

Our project THE GREEN AVENGERS aims at promoting plantation in different parts of a city which will help to tackle various environmental issues such as reducing pollution, reducing global warming, preventing acid rain and various lung diseases. The secondary aim of our project is to promote local plant sellers . We are creating an avengers theme(to protect mother earth)  based plantation website, where one can register as a volunteer and take part in our plantation campaigns. Scores will be provided on the basis of number of plants planted in various campaigns organized by us. On the basis of those scores there profile will be upgraded to an organizer profile by their consent. Now, an organizer has extra features like creating a campaign in his city in any of the selected, required and permitted area and registering a local seller from any area. When volunteers will be planting trees, they would require saplings which they can buy from local sellers suggested by our website to promote locals if they want. Monthly heroes will be chosen on the basis of score and will be provided with plant theme goodies and t-shirt. We will connect schools and institutions as well to promote awareness among young minds. This is completely a non-profit project aiming for a green healthy earth and promoting locals.
